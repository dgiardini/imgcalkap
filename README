ImgCalKap - Simple map calibration tool
For Linux And MS Windows
What it does ?

- Let you choose a kap file, edit the calibration marks and boundaries ....
- ... or open an image file of a raster map (bmp, png, etc), insert some calibration marks (at least two)...
- ... define the boundaries for the chart ....
- ... and save the image as a kap file to use with OpenCPN or other compatible software.

Once a raster image is saved as a kap file, can be edited as often as desired.
Installation:

Windows:
   Unzip anywhere in your computer.

Linux:
You must compile and install by yourself the program. See bottom.
How to use ?
***** BIG WARNING *****

    For kap files, is _very_ important you keep a copy of the original file. This is because is
   converted to PNG and then to kap again. A new file header is generated so you can loose info.
    For pictures, the program will not modify the original file images(bmp,png,etc,other than kap).
***********************
Windows: Start the program with the usual clicking

Linux: Open a terminal,and (assuming you copied the binary to /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) type: #imgcalkap
Click on the initial window and open the image file you want to edit or convert to kap. Then, use
the following keys to do the following actions:

   Keys:
   [+][-] - [PgUp,PgDown]	   Zoom in /out
   [Insert] or [i]	   Insert a new calibration point at mouse position
   [Delete] or [d]	   Delete calibration point under mouse position
   [b]	   Insert a boundary point at mouse position
   [v]	   Delete a boundary point under mouse position
   [home] or [c]	   Move image to cursor
   [0]	   Restore zoom
   [Ctrl +s]	   Open save dialog
   [Esc]	   Exit program

   You can zoom in and then drag the map with the mouse
   Right click on calibration mark to enter coordinates. Use a minus (-) sign for S/W locations, only with the degrees field.
   Right click elsewhere to edit map information
   To drag a boundary point, you must keep pressed the CTRL key and then drag the blue circles using the left button of the mouse
   Press the "s" key to pop up the save dialog.
   Press "Esc" to leave.

The blue circles are the vertices of a polygon (a rectangle in the most basic form), and everything
outside that polygon will be ignored by OpenCPN. For example, you could calibrate
a print screen without edit borders or other undesirables parts of the image. Just define a proper
boundary and the non interesting zones will be hidden.
Command Line

    You can invoke "imgcalkap imagefile" to open "imagefile" and start calibrating.   
Compiling
    First, be sure you have the followings libs already installed in your system:
wxWidgets
OpenCV  On Linux must be compiled WHIT GTK BACKEND ( WITHOUT QT support).
FreeImage

Linux:

Unpack the tgz file in a directory of your choice, for example :
#cp imgcalkap-0.2.tgz /tmp
#cd /tmp
#gunzip -cv imgcalkap-0.2.tgz | tar -xv
#cd imgcalkap-0.2

Then type "make".

Hopefully, you will get an executable file named imgcalkap. Try: #./imgcalkap
If you are satisfied with the result, you can copy the program somewhere into the path, for example
#cp imgcalkap /usr/local/bin

Windows:

   You will need to compile OpenCv, wxWidgets and FreeImage under MinGw, in order to use the same Makefile
    You also can create a Visual Studio project, see the defines in the Makefile to exclude Linux libs
   If you use MinGw, look a the Makefile and point the OPENCV_DIR variable to your OpenCV path. Then type "make".
   You must also copy FreeImage.dll, libopencv dlls,libgcc dll and libstdc dll to the executable dir path.
   
TODO
    - Improve the interface
    - Add imgkap options to the dialogs
    - Add option to export map as image bitmap
   
Known Issues
    - OpenCV doesn't have a method to handle the "close" button. On Windows we avoid the problem disabling
     the "cross" button from the menu. On Linux,this button closes the window but the program will still running
     in background with erratic behaviour.
    - OpenCV low perfomance under Linux ( compilation flags ?)
BUGS
    Plenty, please report them to the email below.
